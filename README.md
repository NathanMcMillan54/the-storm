# The Storm

A small sandbox game that occasionally gets interrupted by a storm.

### Build and install:

``python3`` and ``pip`` are needed to insatll requirements for The Storm.

```command line
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After installing the requirements running ``install.sh`` will generate an executable and files for the game, this will
need ``sudo`` to move the executable to ``/bin``.
